## Moby Dick
Call me Ishmael. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way i have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requeires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off - then, i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; i quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish ver nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

### There now is your insular city of the manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs 
- commerce surrounds it with her surf.
Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by the waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

~~Where does it come from?~~
~~Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.~~

~~The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.~~

~~Where can I get some?~~
~~There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.~~
